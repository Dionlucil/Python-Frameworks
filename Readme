Sources like PMC and WHO contributed the majority of papers.

Challenges:

Handling large dataset size efficiently.

Many missing values (especially abstracts and authors).

Learning how to integrate pandas analysis with Streamlit visualizations.

Learning:

How to perform data cleaning (missing values, datetime handling).

How to generate simple but meaningful visualizations with Matplotlib.

How to build a functional Streamlit application for interactive exploration.

 With this corrected setup, youâ€™ll have:

Clean dataset (data_clean2)

Visualizations in Jupyter Notebook

Streamlit interactive app (app.py)
